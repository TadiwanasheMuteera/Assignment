            <h1>ANSWERS TO QUESTION 1</h1>
            <p>To create a website for a company, here are the steps you can follow: </p>
            <ol>
                <p></p><li> <em>Requirements Gathering:</em></li>
                <br> Meet with the company representatives to understand their goals, target audience, desired features, and design preferences. Gather as much information as possible to ensure a clear understanding of their requirements.</p>
                
                <p><li> <em>Planning and Scope Definition:</em></li>
                <br> Based on the gathered requirements, create a project plan that outlines the project's scope, timeline, deliverables, and resources required. Define the website's structure, including the number of pages, navigation, and content organization.</p>
                
                <p><li> <em>Design and Mockup Creation:</em></li>
                    <br> Create a visual representation of the website's design using wireframing or prototyping tools. Develop a mockup or a set of static design concepts to present to the client for feedback and approval. Iterate on the design until it meets their expectations.</p>
                
                <p><li> <em> Front-end Development: </em></li>
                    <br>Convert the approved design into a functioning website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Implement responsive design techniques to ensure the website is mobile-friendly and compatible with different devices and screen sizes.</p>
                
                <p><li> <em>Back-end Development:</em></li>
                    <br> If the website requires dynamic functionality, such as user authentication, database integration, or content management system (CMS) capabilities, develop the necessary server-side components using technologies like Java, PHP, or Python. Build any required APIs or web services to support data retrieval and processing.</p>
                
                <p><li> <em>Content Creation and Integration: </em></li>
                    <br>Work with the company to gather and create content for the website, including text, images, videos, and other media. Integrate the content into the appropriate sections of the website, ensuring proper formatting and organization.</p>
                
                <p><li> <em>Testing and Quality Assurance:</em></li>
                    <br> Perform thorough testing of the website's functionality, usability, and cross-browser compatibility. Identify and fix any bugs or issues that arise during testing. Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with the company's representatives to ensure the website meets their expectations.</p>
                
                <p><li> <em>Deployment:</em></li>
                    <br> Prepare the website for deployment by configuring web servers, domain registration, and hosting setup. Upload the website files to the production server and perform final checks to ensure everything is functioning correctly.</p>
                
                <p><li> <em>Launch and Post-Launch Support:</em></li>
                    <br> Coordinate with the company to officially launch the website to the public. Monitor the website's performance and address any post-launch issues or updates that may arise. Provide ongoing support and maintenance as required.</p>
                
                <p><li> <em>SEO and Digital Marketing: </em></li>
                    <br>Optimize the website for search engines (SEO) by incorporating relevant keywords, meta tags, and other on-page optimization techniques. Collaborate with the company's marketing team to implement digital marketing strategies to drive traffic to the website.</p>
                
                <p><li> <em>Monitoring and Analytics: </em></li>
                    <br>Set up website analytics tools to monitor visitor behavior, track conversions, and measure the website's performance. Analyze the data to gain insights and make further improvements to the website
